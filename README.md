# Voice-Signal-Analysis-DFT-
A DFT algorithm from scratch to analyze frequencies at 500Hz, 2000Hz, and 16000Hz and a noise filtering algorithm to remove ambient noise, improving signal clarity, and visualized frequency spectra to compare variations across different sentences, participants, and sampling rates.
